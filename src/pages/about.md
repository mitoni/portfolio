I am an architect and a devoted maker.

As a enthusiastic **Technology and Product Leader**, I've spent the last eight years turning diverse ideas into successful products, coordinating every aspect of the process from brainstoriming to R&D, marketing and sales, all while ensuring fruitful collaboration of cross-functional engineering and design teams.

In 2018, I co-founded **moi composites**, a pioneering European tech startup that specializes in advanced composite and robotics-based 3D printing systems. We aimed to revolutionize the industry. As **President and Chief Technology Officer** I led groundbreaking projects such as **MAMBO** and the establishment of **moi dental**, a subsidiary focused on bio-medical solutions.

My career began at Politecnico di Milano's **+LAB**, where I supervised the internationally acclaimed **Atropos** project. This led to important recognitions, including the 2017 JEC Innovation Award and being finalists at the 2017 Dyson Award. As a designer, I also contributed at **REX** in NYC, participating in the development of iconic projects like the Perelman Performing  Arts Center and the Necklace Residence, both of which were featured in prominent publications.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I actively contribute to the academic community as a **teaching assistant** at the School of Architecture of Politecnico di Milano, while also speaking at numerous international conferences and seminars.
