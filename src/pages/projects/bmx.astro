            <p>
                The redesigned BMX Frame marked the beginning of our
                collaboration with <a
                    href="https://www.autodesk.com/"
                    target="_blank">Autodesk</a
                >. This design was created to highlight the capabilities of
                Autodesk's Netfabb software, particularly in the areas of
                additive manufacturing and topological optimization.
            </p>

            <p>
                The BMX was displayed at Formnext 2017 in Frankfurt, Europe's
                largest additive manufacturing exhibition.

            <h3>Optimization algorithms</h3>

            <p>
                Two algorithms were developed for this project and were
                subsequently implemented in Moi's tool pathing software. Both
                algorithms are voxel-based and are built on top of Millipede, a
                renowned Grasshopper plugin for topological optimization. The
                first algorithm was utilized to design the overall shape and to
                remove superfluous materials, whereas the second determined the
                directions of maximum stress, which then guided the robot's
                path.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, Autodesk Netfabb, combined with the Additive plugin—now
                a part of the Fusion360 suite—was employed to import these paths
                and generate a robotic toolpath.

            <h3>Printing fine tuning</h3>

            <p>
                For this project utilizing continuous fiber, specific 3D
                printing algorithms were developed. Their design aimed to join
                fibers in a manner that maximized a single path, making the
                printing process more efficient. Consequently, the time needed
                for the cutting phase was substantially reduced.
            </p>

            <p>
                An initial, basic fiber cutting mechanism was introduced for
                this project. This laid the foundation for subsequent
                advancements.
