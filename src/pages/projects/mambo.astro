            <h3>Dreaming big</h3>

            <p>
                MAMBO stands as a testament to innovation. It's the world's
                first 3D printed fiberglass boat, a brainchild of moi
                composites, a company I'm proud to have co-founded. Our aim with
                MAMBO was to vividly demonstrate the potential of our 3D
                printing technology.
            </p>

            <p>
                The genesis of this project traces back to a 2018 conversation
                with Autodesk, our long time partner. Their belief in our vision
                led them to sponsor part of our journey. Together, we aspired to
                create something monumental, highlighting Fusion 360's design
                prowess coupled with CFM technology. This synergy allowed us to
                craft not just intricate designs but also robust structures,
                blending the magic of 3D printing with advanced composites.

            <p>
                By the time summer 2020 came to a close, our project had
                beautifully taken shape. Following its completion, MAMBO earned
                recognition in top-tier magazines across the globe. This nod of
                approval was a heartening moment for our team.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond the press, various shipyards expressed their interest,
                keen on infusing our technology into their craftsmanship. As for
                MAMBO itself, it's not just a sight to behold but a thrill to
                navigate, effortlessly cruising at speeds close to 25 knots.

            <h3>MAMBO's celebrated debut</h3>

            <p>
                In fall 2020, MAMBO made its first appearance on the global
                stage at the Genova Boat Show, an esteemed gathering in the same
                league as Cannes, Monaco, and Fort Lauderdale. The event was
                enriched when Carla De Maria, a distinguished figure in the
                yachting world, inaugurated our creation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The culmination of our efforts was recognized when MAMBO was
                honored with the Design Innovation Award from UCINA, Italy's
                premier boat association. This acknowledgment not only
                celebrated our craftsmanship but also marked a significant
                milestone in our journey.
