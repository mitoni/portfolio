            <h3>A jewel box for individual lifestyles</h3>

            <p>
                Before I joined the REX office, the team had won a contest to
                design a private residence in Long Island. This residence
                consisted of several houses arranged around a courtyard, facing
                one another.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each house was linked by a central corridor. Within certain
                houses, there were shared spaces where families could gather.
                These spaces also acted as entrances to the main corridor.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was responsible for designing these shared spaces and the
                unique <strong>functional sculptures</strong> within them. Made
                of wood, these curved sculptures added character to the area,
                breaking the monotony of the square designs, and making the
                overall experience more engaging.

            <h3>The wooden sculptures</h3>

            <p>
                The design concept aimed to transform the wooden wall of the
                homes facing the courtyard into a multifunctional space. This
                new design serves as a staircase connecting to the outside, a
                play slide for children, and a bar area for adults.
            </p>

            <p>
                Due to the intricacies of crafting such a versatile space by
                twisting and morphing solid objects, I created scripts to
                streamline the design process. These scripts allowed for quicker
                iterations, eventually leading to the final design.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, both the houses and the shared spaces are under
                construction.

            <h3>Visualizing designs</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>3D printing</strong> played a pivotal role in our design
                process. It marked my initial exposure to additive manufacturing
                technologies, which subsequently led to my research position at
                <strong>+LAB</strong>, Politecnico di Milano University, and the
                eventual foundation of moi composites.
            </p>

            <p>
                We predominantly utilized <strong>SLA</strong> technology for 3D
                printing our designs. The printed models were presented in both
                internal discussions and client meetings, facilitating a prompt
                comprehension of the design by both our team and the client.
