            <h3>Seamless adoption</h3>

            <p>
                The main barrier to the adoption of Hi-Fiber products was the
                familiarity of dentists and dental labs with their established
                protocols. To facilitate the transition, <a
                    href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi-fjw9bJZuJxq4GYHwtCSEg8nVU_ESSn&si=Xu-w1J_H5hVjtUSc"
                    target="_blank">video tutorials</a
                >, custom web interfaces, and design software were created to
                provide an easier way to learn and use the product.
            </p>

            <p>
                Due to the limited availability of alternative solutions for
                working with fibers instead of solids, there was a need to
                develop <strong>Hi-Design</strong>, a user-friendly software
                that is the first of its kind. This software is specifically
                designed to <strong>seamlessly integrate</strong> continuous
                fiber composites design into the production process, offering a
                comprehensive solution for clinicians and dental labs looking to
                take advantage of the benefits of Hi-Fiber without the hassle of
                learning a new set of tools.
